Other commands, and notes on usage:

-----
Possible section head levels:
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{This is subsection}
\subsubsection{This is subsubsection}
\paragraph{This is the paragraph}

-----
Captions:
 If you use index commands within a caption, precede \inx or \inxx with
 \protect.

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{\protect\inx{Oscillograph} for memory address access ....
memory plane.}
\end{figure}

-----
Tables:
 Remember to use \centering for a small table and to start the table
 with \hline, use \hline underneath the column headers and at the end of 
 the table. Column headers should be in italic:

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Small Table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\sphline
\it one&\it two&\it three\\
\sphline
C&D&E\\
\sphline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For a table that expands to the width of the page, write

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcc}
\hline
....
\end{tabular*}
%% Sample table notes:
\begin{tablenotes}
$^a$Refs.~19 and 20.

$^b\kappa, \lambda>1$.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

-----
%% Use \printindex if you are using the LaTeX Makeindex commands:
%% \makeindex and \index{}
%\printindex

%% Use \kluwerprintindex if you are using the Kluwer indexing macros:
%%(\inx{} and \inxx{})
\kluwerprintindex

Kluwer Index commands:
\inx{term} will print `term' in text but will also send `term' and its
page number to the .inx file.

\inxx{term} will not print in text but will send term and its page number to
the .inx file.

\inxx{term,second term} will not print in text but will send `second term'
to inx file to print underneath `term' in the index.

1) Run Latex on file,
2) Run sort routine on file ie. `sort < filename.inx > filename.srt' on
your system to produce a filename.srt file
3)\printindex at end of book will input filename.srt and print index.

See documentation for more information.

Algorithm.
Maintains same fonts as text (as opposed to verbatim which uses fixed
width fonts). Space at beginning of line will be maintained if you
use \ at beginning of line.

\begin{algorithm}
{\bf state\_transition algorithm} $\{$
\        for each neuron $j\in\{0,1,\ldots,M-1\}$
\        $\{$   
\            calculate the weighted sum $S_j$ using Eq. (6);
\            if ($S_j>t_j$)
\                    $\{$turn ON neuron; $Y_1=+1\}$   
\            else if ($S_j<t_j$)
\                    $\{$turn OFF neuron; $Y_1=-1\}$   
\            else
\                    $\{$no change in neuron state; $y_j$ remains %
unchanged;$\}$ .
\        $\}$   
$\}$

i.e.,
\begin{glossary}
\term{GaAs}Gallium Arsinide. For similar device sizes GaAs transistors 
have three to
five times greater transconductance than those of of silicon bipolar
and MOS transistors.

\term{VLSI}Very Large Scale Integration. Since the mid-1970's 
VLSI technology has been successfully used in many areas, but its effect on
computers of all shapes and sizes has been the most dramatic. Some of the
application areas got boosts in performance while others became
feasible.
