\section[All the Things that can be Done with Figure Captions]
{All the Things that can be Done\\ with Figure Captions}

Here are some examples of various kinds of figure captions
that can be use with this Kluwer style. They include the
normal \LaTeX\ \verb+\caption{}+ as well as many more possibilities
which you will see illustrated here.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\vskip.2in
\caption{Short caption.}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The following example shows a caption which includes an indexing command.
Notice that there is a \verb+\protect+ command before the \verb+\inx+.
This keeps \LaTeX\ from expanding the \verb+\inx+ command at
the wrong time.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{\protect\inx{Oscillograph} for memory address access operations, showing 500 ps
address access time and $\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta\sum_{123}^{345}$
\protect\inx{superimposed signals}%
\protect\inxx{address,superimposed
signals} of address access in 1 kbit
memory plane.}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Here is an example of a double caption; one figure with two
captions appearing side by side:

%% Double captions:
\begin{figure}[ht]
\sidebyside
{\caption{This caption will go on the left side of
the page. It is the initial caption of two side-by-side captions.}}
{\caption{This caption will go on the right side of
the page. It is the second of two side-by-side captions.}}
\end{figure}

\noindent
When you need a continued caption for a second figure that
uses the same number as the preceding one as a continuation
of the previous figure:

%% For continued caption. Same figure number used as for last caption.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\contcaption{This is a continued caption.}
\end{figure}
\inxx{captions,figure}

\noindent
When you want to make a narrow caption, you can use the
\verb=\narrowcaption= command.

%% To make narrow caption:
\begin{figure}[ht]
\narrowcaption{This is a narrow caption so that it can
be at the side of the illustration. This is a narrow caption.
This is a narrow caption. This is a narrow caption.}
\end{figure}

\noindent
You may also make a narrow continued caption as you see in
the following example.

%% To make narrow continued caption:
\begin{figure}[ht]
\narrowcontcaption{This is a narrow continued caption.
This is a narrow continued caption. This is a narrow continued caption.}
\end{figure}

\noindent
When you need to make a lettered caption, you may use the command\newline
\verb+\letteredcaption{}{}+. The first argument is
for the letter.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\letteredcaption{a}{Lettered caption.}
\end{figure}
\inxx{captions,lettered}


Notice that you can have lettered captions in the side by side
environment, which is one of the places that lettered captions
may be most useful. 


\begin{figure}[ht]
\sidebyside
{
\letteredcaption{b}{One caption.}}
{
\letteredcaption{c}{Two captions.}}
\end{figure}

\section{Making Tables}\inxx{Making tables}
Notice that the caption should be at the top of the table. Use
a line above the table, under the column heads, and at the
end of the table. If you use the Kluwer command, \verb+\sphline+
instead of the \LaTeX\ command \verb+\hline+, you will get
a little space added above and below the line, which will
make your table look more elegant.

This form of the tabular command makes the
table spread out to the width of the page.
This example also shows using \verb+\caption[]{}+ with the
first argument, in square brackets, used to send information
to the List of Tables. 


\begin{table}[ht]
\caption[Effects of the Two Types of Scaling Proposed by Dennard 
and Co-Workers.]%<-- this version will appear in List of Tables
{Effects of the Two Types of Scaling Proposed by \protect\inx{Dennard} 
and\newline
Co-Workers.$^{a,b}$}%<-- this version will appear on page
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcc}
\sphline
\it Parameter&\it $\kappa$ Scaling &\it $\kappa$, $\lambda$ Scaling\cr
\sphline
Dimension&$\kappa^{-1}$&$\lambda^{-1}$\cr
Voltage&$\kappa^{-1}$&$\kappa^{-1}$\cr
Currant&$\kappa^{-1}$&$\lambda/\kappa^{2}$\cr
\inx{Dopant Concentration}&$\kappa$&$\lambda^2/\kappa$\cr
\sphline
\end{tabular*}
\begin{tablenotes}
$^a$Refs.~19 and 20.

$^b\kappa, \lambda>1$.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}
\inxx{captions,table}

\noindent
Tables may use both the\verb+\sidebyside+ and the 
\verb+\letteredcaption+ command to position the tables
side by side and letter the captions.

\begin{table}[ht]
\sidebyside
{\letteredcaption{a}{A small table with a lettered table caption.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcr}\sphline
\it $\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&\it Two&\it Three\cr\sphline
one&two&three\cr\sphline
\end{tabular}
\label{table2a}}
{\letteredcaption{b}{A small table with a second lettered table caption.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcr}\sphline
\it $\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&\it Two&\it Three\cr\sphline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr\sphline
\end{tabular}
\label{table2b}}
\end{table}

\newpage
The following table shows  how you might increase vertical space between
particular lines with the use of a `strut', a vertical line with no width
so that it doesn't print, but which does have a height and/or
depth.

It also shows how to make a table with vertical lines, if you
find them absolutely necessary, by supplying and extra column
entry in the preamble, which you never use in the body of the
table. This makes the vertical line position itself correctly.


\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Here is a table caption.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c||l}
\hline
  %% On the next line is an example of how to get extra vertical space in
  %% a line: Use a \vrule with width 0pt and the height or depth that you
  %% want.
\it Cell\vrule height 14pt width 0pt depth 4pt
&\it Time (sec.)&\cr
\hline
\hline
1&432.22\vrule height 12pt width0pt&\cr
%%
%% On the next line, see how to line up numbers aligned on their decimal point
2&\phantom{3}32.32&\cr
3&\phantom{33}2.32&\cr
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The following table uses a continued caption, made with the command
\verb+\contcaption{}+.


\begin{table}[ht]
\contcaption{This is a continued caption.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c||l}

\subsection{Figure, Table and Appendices in Landscape Mode}
These commands should be used for landscape figures, tables,
and appendices. In order for them to actually print in
landscape mode you will need to use the appropriate command
with your printer driver, a command which differs according
to which printer driver you are using. You can print
examples of these commands by uncommenting {\tt \string\end{document}}
at the end of this sample.

This is how to make a figure caption to be turned sideways on page:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{widefigure}
\caption{This is a wide figure caption.  It is meant to be 
printed in landscape mode (sideways).  This page should be 
turned sideways when the driver program is used to translate 
the .dvi file to the file that is sent to the printer.}
\end{widefigure}
\end{verbatim}}

This is how to make a sideways table caption:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{widetable}
\caption{This is a wide table caption.  It is meant to be 
printed in landscape mode (sideways).  This page should be 
turned sideways when the driver program is used to translate 
the .dvi file to the file that is sent to the printer.} 
\end{widetable} 
\end{verbatim}}

This is how to do an appendix printed sideways:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{landscapemode}
\appendix{Interest Rate Liberalization Through 1988}
This is the text of the appendix.
This is the text of the appendix.
\end{landscapemode}
\end{verbatim}}

\section[Small Running Head]{Some Sample Algorithms}
When you want to demonstrate some programming code, these are
the commands to use. Lines will be preserved as you see them
on the screen, as will spaces at the beginning of the line.%
\inxx{algorithm,State transition}\inxx{algorithm}
A backslash followed with a space will indent the line. 
Blank lines will be preserved.
Math and font changes may be used. 

\begin{algorithm}
{\bf state\_transition algorithm} $\{$
\        for each neuron $j\in\{0,1,\ldots,M-1\}$
\        $\{$   
\            calculate the weighted sum $S_j$ using Eq. (6);
\            if ($S_j>t_j$)
\                    $\{$turn ON neuron; $Y_1=+1\}$   
\            else if ($S_j<t_j$)
\                    $\{$turn OFF neuron; $Y_1=-1\}$   
\            else
\                    $\{$no change in neuron state; $y_j$ remains %
unchanged;$\}$.
\        $\}$   
$\}$   
\end{algorithm}

Here is another sample algorithm:

%% \bit will produce bold italics if you are using PostScript fonts, 
%% boldface in Computer Modern.

\begin{algorithm}
{\bit Evaluate-Single-FOE} ({\bf x$_f$, I$_0$, I$_1$}):
\ {\bf I}+ := {\bf I}$_1$;
\ ($\phi,\theta$) := (0,0);
\ {\it repeat}\note{/*usually only 1 interation required*/}
\ \ (s$_{opt}${\bf E}$_\eta$) := {\bit Optimal-Shift} ({\bf I$_0$,I$^+$,I$_0$,x$_f$});
\ \ ($\phi^+$, $\theta^+$) := {\bit Equivalent-Rotation} ({\bf s}$_{opt}$);
\ \ ($\phi$, $\theta$) := ($\phi$, $\theta$) + ($\phi^+$, $\theta^+$);
\ \ {\bf I}$^+$:= {\bit Derotate-Image} ({\bf I}$_1$, $\phi$, $\theta$);
\ \ {\it until} ($\|\phi^+\|\leq\phi_{max}$ \& $\|\theta^+\|\leq\theta_{max}$);
\ {\it return} ({\bf I}$^+$, $\phi$, $\theta$, E$_\eta$).

End pseudo-code.
\end{algorithm}
\inxx{code,Pseudo}

% Notice that to produce printed `{' brackets, precede them with \string

% Notice that \begin{codebox}...\end{codebox} can be inserted within
%   codesamp, and will be positioned at the same distance from right

five times greater transconductance than those of of silicon bipolar
and MOS transistors.

\term{VLSI}Very Large Scale Integration. Since the mid-1970's 
VLSI technology has been successfully used in many areas, but its effect on
computers of all shapes and sizes has been the most dramatic. Some of the
application areas got boosts in performance while others became
feasible.

\section{Sample Chapter Bibliography Using BibTeX}
If you would rather make a bibliography using Bib\TeX\ write, 
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliographystyle{apalike}
\chapbblname{chapbib}
\chapbibliography{logic}
\end{verbatim}
Substitute the name of your .bbl file for {\tt chapbib}
above;
substitute
the name of your .bib file for {\tt logic} above.
If you don't
have apalike.bst on your system, you can get it from Kluwer at
the same .ftp site where you can find the book style files.

This will allow many Bib\TeX\ bibliographies in one book.
This example shows the chapter bibliography using
\verb+\normallatexbib+.
See the documentation, KapProc.doc, for more information.


{%\normallatexbib


\bibliographystyle{apalike}
\chapbblname{chapbib}
\chapbibliography{logic}

}
